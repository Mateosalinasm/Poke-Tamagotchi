# Welcome to Poke-Tamagotchi

Project Description: Poke-Tamagotchi is a web application designed as a virtual pet game inspired by Pokemon. The game allows users to take care of their Pokemon by feeding, playing, and making sure it gets enough rest. The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
